## Purpose

The purpose of the portfolio website is to help present myself to prospective employers by showcasing my personality, skills, professional knowledge
and projects in an interactive manner. I'm aiming for a one-stop-shop for who I am and what I can do as a fullstack developer that gets straight to the point and
presented in an accessible website that is also aesthetically pleasing.

## Features

The site is very simple by design and I aim to keep it this way. There are 4 HTML documents that all link together:

 ![Sitemap](/docs/T1A2_siteMap.png)
 
 - Home page
 - About page
 - Blog page
 - Project page
 
Through these 4 pages, I will be able to effectively communicate the website's purpose. 

I have a responsive navigation bar that is fixed to the top that adjusts on different screen sizes for accessibility:

This will be the main component to the website and crucial for navigating and accessing information which is why I decided to make it very prominently displayed
and have made it responsive for nearly all screen sizes.

Each page has a hero section with some type of image to communicate the purpose of the page displayed right at the top as I think it is a good way of capturing the audience's attention. I have created an image container that I reuse across nearly all the pages and have made this container responsive for ease of use if I want to add more images in the future.

Every section of all pages is enclosed in a responsive container that adjusts for many screen sizes. This is for ease of use and resuability if I want to add more content to a page. I have written the container first in the HTML with a section ID of "responsive-container".

This will also make it handy for accessibility and implementation as it easily divides each page into sections and I have set up many breakpoints for this container which made my life easier when adjusting each pages and its sections for a responsive layout.

To the bottom of each page I have a socials box with an image and link box that I can and have reused across all pages for ease of use if I decide to add more social media accounts/forms of contact. It also has a footer mainly for aesthetic purposes to nicely end the bottom of each page.
